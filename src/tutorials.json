      "Try breaking complex forms into basic shapes. Once you get into the mindset of understanding forms as a collection of shapes ontop of eachother, it can really help with setting up the compositions and poses.",

      "Practice! Practice doesn't quite make perfect but it can get you very close. Practice will get you more familiar with techniques and understanding the forms you are creating."
